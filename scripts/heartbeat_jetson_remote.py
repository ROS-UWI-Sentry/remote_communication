## This code is to publish a message to the broswer so that it can respond
#and the ROS on the jetson would know that it is connected 

#It counts up to 30 seconds then publishes a request to the remote
#if the remote does not respond within another 30 seconds the
#code will stop counting and continuously output "turn_off_sentry"
#on the "sentry_control_topic"
